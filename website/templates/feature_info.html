<h1>Audio Features</h1>
<p>Melomatics' audio analysis page allows you to see data about your favourite tracks displayed in a visual manner. While these features tend to be accurate, inaccurate values are not too uncommon, so please exercise you own judgement in conjunction with the tool. It provides 7 different catagories, which are explained below:  </p>
<h4>Danceability</h4>
<p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. </p>
<h4>Energy</h4>
<p>Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. </p>
<h4>Speechiness</h4>
<p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 10 dots the attribute value. Values above 6 dots describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 3 and 6 dots describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 3 dots most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</p>
<h4>Acousticness</h4>
<p>A confidence measure from 0 to 10 dots of whether the track is acoustic. 10 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</p>
<h4>Instrumentalness</h4>
<p>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 10 dots, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 5 dots are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 10.</p>
<h4>Positivity</h4>
<p>A measure from 0 to 10 dots describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high positivity sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low positivity sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). </p>
<h4>BPM (Beats per minute)</h4>
<p>This is a measure of the number of beats per minute in a track. Please be aware that certain songs with more complex beat patterns often appear at much higher BPM values than expected.</p>
